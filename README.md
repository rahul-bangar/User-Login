Project Overview:
In this project, I designed and developed a user login webpage using PHP, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The application allows users to create an account by providing their name, age, gender, email, and password. It also enables users to securely log in using their registered email and password. The user details are stored in a SQL Server database to ensure data persistence and security.

Features:

User Registration: Users can easily create an account by filling out a registration form that collects their name, age, gender, email, and password. The PHP backend validates and sanitizes the user inputs to prevent malicious data.

Secure Password Handling: To protect user accounts, the application uses PHP's built-in password hashing functions to securely store passwords in the database. This ensures that user credentials remain safe and unreadable in case of a breach.

Login Authentication: The login functionality verifies the user's email and password against the stored hashed password in the database. If the credentials match, the user is granted access; otherwise, clear error messages are displayed.

Responsive Design: The webpage is built with a responsive design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, ensuring an optimal user experience across various devices and screen sizes.

SQL Server Database Integration: User account details, including name, age, gender, email, and hashed passwords, are stored in a SQL Server database. The PHP backend handles the database connections, queries, and data manipulation.

Form Validation: Both the registration and login forms implement robust client-side and server-side validation to ensure that users provide valid and complete information.

Security Measures: The application incorporates security best practices, such as input validation and using prepared statements, to prevent common web vulnerabilities, like SQL injection and cross-site scripting (XSS).

Tech Stack:

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
Backend: PHP
Database: SQL Server (or any SQL-based database)
Challenges:

Implementing secure password hashing and salting to ensure password confidentiality.
Managing user sessions and authentication to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive areas of the website.
Designing an efficient and normalized database schema to store user information securely.
